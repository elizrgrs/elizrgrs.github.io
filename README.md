## About Me

Hi! My name is Elizabeth Rogers (she/her). 

I am a senior at [Harvey Mudd College](https://www.hmc.edu) studying Mathematics and concentrating in Gender and Women's studies.


## Scholarship 

I am generally intersted in operations research, which combines my interests in applied math and computer science. Lately I have been interested in problems relating to the power sector.

This summer I worked in the [Rigorous Systems Research Group](https://rsrg.cms.caltech.edu/) on a public health aware optimal power flow model under the guidance of Dr. Adam Wierman and Dr. Nicolas Christianson in the Caltech Computing and Mathematical Sciences department. This project addresses the public health impact of power grid management and electricity generation. A poster further detailing our work can be accessed here: \[to be added\]

For my senior thesis at Harvey Mudd College, I am working with the [all-pairs vitality-maximization problem (VIMAX)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10479-024-06022-4), formulated by my advisor Dr. Susan E. Martonosi and Dr. Alice Paul. VIMAX provides a way to maximize the flow through a specific node in a given netowork. However, right now it is computationally difficult to solve for large systems (graphs of size 40+ nodes). Thus, I am looking at speedups to our solver, which implements Benders Decomposition. My thesis specific website can be accessed [here](https://sites.google.com/g.hmc.edu/rogers-senior-thesis?usp=sharing). 

## Personal Interests

### I love music in all forms listening, making, sharing, and experiencing! 

#### Radio
Find me on the airwaves Saturday afternoons 4-5pm PST at [KSPC 88.7 Claremont](https://kspc.org/), where I co-host Wizards.fm with my fellow mage DJ NO. Listen in and say hi in the spinitron chat!

#### Listening
I primarily listen to music on [Tidal](https://tidal.com/), though I've recently been finding great stuff on [Nina Protocol](https://www.ninaprotocol.com/). Nina is a relatively new streaming service built on community values to support independent artists. In fact, artists on Nina receive 100% of any music sales! You can use my referal [link here](https://www.ninaprotocol.com/?invite=6anUAk9ecyMEVYR2u3xs9H77meL1Nebw1LLBkpZAhy3T&ref=6anUAk9ecyMEVYR2u3xs9H77meL1Nebw1LLBkpZAhy3T) to try it out!

I also enjoy fun streaming statistics. Let's be friends on [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/altostratus_)

#### Community
I love going to local shows! Bump to [Freakscene.diy](https://freakscene.diy/), a positing board for diy events where you can connect with your local scene outside of social media :P

### Reading and Thinking and Pondering

I love to read! Currently I am catching up on readings from my queer affect theory class, but I also enjoy sci-fi, the ocasional memoir, queer romcoms, and a good contemp lit book that makes me think about life. Let's be friends on [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/altostratus) :)

### This Blog

I was inspired to make this blog in the minimal web style after my professor [Lucas Bang](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~bang/index.html).
