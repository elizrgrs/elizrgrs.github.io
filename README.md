## About Me

My name is Elizabeth Rogers (she/her). 

I am a senior at [Harvey Mudd College](https://www.hmc.edu) studying Mathematics and concentrating in Gender and Women's studies. #WIBSTR


## Scholarship 

I am generally intersted in operations research, accomidates my interests in applied math and computer science. Lately I have been interested in problems relating to the power sector.

This summer I worked in the [Rigorous Systems Research Group](https://rsrg.cms.caltech.edu/) on a public health aware optimal power flow model under the guidance of Dr. Adam Wierman and Dr. Nicolas Christianson in the Caltech Computing and Mathematical Sciences department. This project addresses the public health impact of power grid management and electricity generation. A poster further detailing our work can be accessed here: 

For my senior thesis at Harvey Mudd College, I am working on the [all-pairs vitality-maximization problem (VIMAX)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10479-024-06022-4), which was formulated by my advisor Dr. Susan E. Martonosi and Dr. Alice Paul. My thesis specific website can be accessed [here](https://sites.google.com/g.hmc.edu/rogers-senior-thesis?usp=sharing). VIMAX is an NP-Hard network interdiction problem which I am still learning about, but in general my thesis will look at why the Benders decomposition algorithm solves VIMAX on some types of graphs but not others. I will be updating my thesis website as I make more progress in the area! 

## Personal Interests

### I love music in all forms listening, making, sharing, and experiencing! 

#### Radio
Find me on the airwaves on Saturday afternoons 4-5pm PST at [KSPC 88.7 Claremont](https://kspc.org/), where I co-host Wizards.fm with my fellow mage DJ NO. Listen in and say hi in the spinitron chat!

#### Listening
I primarily listen to music on [Tidal](https://tidal.com/) and [Nina Protocol](https://www.ninaprotocol.com/), and collect CDs for at home listening! Mandatory plug to [United Musicians and Allied Workers](https://weareumaw.org/) who are doing great work.

I also enjoy fun streaming statistics. Let's be friends on [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/altostratus_)

#### Community
I love going to local shows! Bump to [Freakscene.diy](https://freakscene.diy/), a positing board for diy events where you can connect with your local scene outside of social media :P

### Reading and Thinking and Pondering

I love to read! Currently I am catching up on readings from my queer affect theory class, but I also enjoy sci-fi, the ocasional memoir, queer romcoms, and a good contemp lit book that makes me think about life. Let's be friends on [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/altostratus) :)
